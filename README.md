# Chat app

This is a chating app built using modern web technologies such as Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. I have also used MongoDB to store user data and messages while using vanilla javascript for the front end (it was one of my first big projects and I didn't knew how to use any frameworks like react at the time).


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Chat-app
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Or your can check it live on https://chat-app-9itw.onrender.com (laoding time and video calling might have some bugs due to free server plan from render)
